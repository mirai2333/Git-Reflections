I can clearly see what was changed.
That help me find where is wrong.

You can use whatever you want by version control,like  game saves.

If you manual sublime your file,you will get a clearly logic relationship.
If you don't the versions man be too many to read.

Because they are made for diffrient people?

"git log" will list the commits and "git dff [id1] [id2]" will compare their diffrients!

Because I can return to the time when it's right.
